/*
 * MergeQuantileStream - Find median and other percentiles of streamed data with high accuracy. 
 * 
 * The public API of this class is quite simple. To add a data point to the set, simply call 
 * stream(data). To find a particular quantile (a number n such that some percentage of the
 * data is less than n), just call find_quantile(quantile expressed as a double between 0 and 1)
 * 
 * The big advantage of this algorithm is that the whole data set doesn't need to fit in memory. 
 * In fact, the memory complexity is O(log(n)). Streaming a data point or finding a percentile 
 * has complexity O(log(n)) as well. 
 * 
 * Algorithm Description: 
 * 
 * This algorithm works by sorting the data into "ranks", each of a specified size. Each rank has 
 * twice the significance of the last. So, rank 3 will hold the equivalent of (rank_size) * 2^3 
 * data points, while rank 1 will hold (rank_size) * 2^1 data points. 
 * 
 * New data points are added into a temporary array. Once rank_size data points have been gathered, 
 * they transform into rank 0. If we don't have a rank 0 right now, we can simply store it and 
 * start building the next one. However, if we do have a rank 0, we turn the two of them into a rank 1
 * by merging adjacent pairs of data points. So the lowest two points from both sets will become one 
 * point in the new set and so on. 
 * 
 * In this way, each point in a given rank is the equivalent of two data points in a rank below it. 
 * 
 * Then we look for a rank 1. If one already exists, we merge it with the new rank 1 and continue up. 
 * We do this until we find an empty space. The result is something like incrementing a binary number, 
 * with bits combining and carrying into the next place. 
 * 
 * To find a quantile, we simply walk through all of the ranks, counting how many rank 0 data points 
 * have been passed until we find the right number. Then we can return the next data point.
